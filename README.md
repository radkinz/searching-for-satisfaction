# SEARCHING-FOR-STATISFACTION
An HSE Final Project by Ruby, Jack Dev., Jack Doz., and Liam

### **_ORIGINAL PLAN_**

#### **Description:**

Our product, _Searching for Satisfaction_ (or Lyric Search), allows people to discover music that best caters to their desires and musical tastes. All data will derive from the database [millionsongdataset.com/musixmatch/](url) and will match with the user’s inputted wants. Our project will index lyrics to allow a user to search based on select inputs to be interpreted by our program. We will take, as our minimum viable product, a few words to match the “vibe” (or lyrics) of a specific song. Lyrics will be stemmed, as to make searching (in regards to tenses) more seamless. 


#### **Common nouns:**

“Listener” or “User”: a person who uses software derived from this project. 
“Song” or “Lyrics”: content derived from the Million Song Dataset. 
“Input”: a strand of words to connect wants with products.


#### **Functional Requirements:**
- [ ] It should run without large-scale errors. 
- [ ] It should take in multiple user inputs, which it can use to search. 
- [ ] It should provide the user with a song that aptly matches their inputs. 
- [ ] It should utilize the inputs to search the index. 
- [ ] It should count the number of times that a page has been visited. 
- [ ] It should have a ranking algorithm, which can help a user determine which song might be most appropriate for their desired vibe. 
- [ ] It could be able to have search filters such as “exact phrasing,” which looks through the index for the exact line that has been searched. 
- [ ] It could include a video/ audio that is associated with the song on its “page.”

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

- [ ] It should satisfy the user. 
- [ ] The UI should be easy to understand. 
- [ ] The product should be easily accessible.
