  <div id="user_stories">
    As an angsty teen, I would like to get music that can make me feel the
    emotions that I no longer feel.
    <br /><br />
    As a buff athlete who prioritizes sports too much, I want music lyrics that
    can make me GET IN THE ZONE while I workout.
    <br /><br />
    As a student who has succumbed to the mono-toned, lifeless regime of a
    try-hard, I want music lyrics that can help me concentrate while I study.
    <br /><br />
    As a driver, I wish for music that will inspire me to, in fact, stay in my
    own lane.
    <br /><br />
    As someone who has watched "Gilmore Girls" a few too many times, I would
    like riffs that make all my surroundings seem like Stars Hollow, CT.
    <br /><br />
    As a chaotic teen, I want music to inspire and enlighten my inner Olivia
    Rodrigo.
    <br /><br />
    As an introvert, I need music that allows me to stay away from other people
    as much as possible
    <br /><br />
    As an aspiring joyrider, I want to make a playlist that fits driving through
    the both the country-side and city skylines at 9:00pm
